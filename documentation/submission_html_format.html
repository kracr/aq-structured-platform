<h1 id="sec:intro">Introduction</h1>
<p>Air pollution is a significant problem across the major cities of the
  World and is also a part of the sustainable development goals. Tackling it, however, is a rather
  complex task as the solution lies at the intersection of society,
  politics, science and technology. Air pollution has substantial spatial
  variance. Even within one city, air quality can vary a lot depending on
  the locality, close proximity with industrial areas, population density
  etc.</p>
<p>In order to tackle air pollution, the government agencies frame
  policies for mitigating the sources of pollution, increasing the civic
  engagement and promoting the standardized air quality indices such as
  the Air Quality Index (AQI). In this work, we delve into the latter two
  aspects, i.e., improving the community engagement and studying AQI from
  the perspective of different social cohorts. This lead to a socially
  relevant AQI, which we named, Social AQI (SAQI).</p>
<p>We conducted an ethnographic survey at six different locations in
  Delhi, India, which is one of the most polluted cities in the World. At
  these six locations, we have also deployed air quality sensors to record
  the hyperlocal AQI. The details of the data collection and the survey
  results are discussed in Section. In
  order to model and integrate these disparate and heterogenous datasets,
  we built a SAQI Ontology (SAQIO). This ontology<span class="citation" data-cites="Ont-NG-2009"></span> captures the
  relationship between the
  seemingly unrelated concepts in the datasets, which in turn are used to
  construct a Knowledge Graph (KG) <span class="citation" data-cites="KG-ACMSurvey2021"></span> from these datasets. A
  SAQI app is
  built on top of the KG. This app takes into account the different social
  cohorts and their understanding of the AQI. The following are our
  contributions.</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>An ontology (SAQIO) that models the data from the air quality
      sensors and the ethnographic survey data. SAQIO is built using our
      Pollution ontology design pattern<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref">. SAQIO
        is available at <a href="https://github.com/XXXX/XX-XXXXXXXX-XXXXXXX"
          class="uri">https://github.com/XXXX/XX-XXXXXXXX-XXXXXXX</a> and the
        documentation is at <a href="https://saqi-er24.netlify.app/saqi"

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An SAQI KG that integrates the air pollution data from local and
      central sensors with the data from the ethnographic survey. YARRML<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
        role="doc-noteref"> is used to convert the sensor and
        survey data into a KG. These mappings, along with the SHACL<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
          role="doc-noteref"> constraints and SPARQL queries on
          the KG, are available at <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.XXXXXXX"
            class="uri">https://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.XXXXXXX</a>. The SPARQL
          endpoint over the KG is available at <a href="https://saqi-er24.netlify.app/sparql" #/dataset/aq-store/query"
            class="uri">https://https://saqi-er24.netlify.app/saqi/sparql/#/dataset/aq-store/query</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An SAQI App that is built using the KG to encourage community
      engagement and response. This is available at <a href="https://saqi-er24.netlify.app/"
        class="uri">https://saqi-er24.netlify.app/</a>.</p>

  <li>
    <p>The two datasets – ethnographic survey questionnaire and
      responses and the hyperlocal air quality data from six different
      locations in Delhi. This is available at <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.XXXXXXX"
        class="uri">https://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.XXXXXXX</a>. These
      datasets will be helpful to social scientists, environmental scientists,
      biophysicists and biochemists.</p>

<h1 id="sec:rel-work">Related Work</h1>
<p>There are a few existing ontologies related to air pollution and air
  quality. Adeleke et al., <span class="citation" data-cites="adeleke"></span> built an ontology to model pollution as a
  part of a web of IoT sensors. Their ontology is used in an indoor air
  pollution monitoring and control application. Mihaela et al., <span class="citation"
    data-cites="AIRPOLLUTIONONTO"></span>, developed an
  ontology to model air pollution. They used human experts and heuristic
  rules generated through machine learning techniques as knowledge
  sources. They use the ontology to monitor and control air pollution in
  urban regions. Riga et al., <span class="citation" data-cites="marina_riga_2018_1196023"></span> use ontologies to
  make
  efficient environmental decision support systems. Ontologies are used to
  model the status of the environment and its impact on citizens’ health
  and actions. Mertal et al., <span class="citation" data-cites="metral"></span> use CityGML and aim to connect 3D city
  models with air pollution ontologies for sustainable urban
  development.</p>
<p>Some of the applications related to air pollution have focused on
  categorizing AQI value into good, poor and severe to generate
  recommendations on actions to be performed. Examples of such
  applications are CPCBcrr<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> by CPCB,
  AQICN<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> and
  SAFAR<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>. The forecasting system
  developed by
  SAFAR predicts air quality and generates recommendations a few days
  ahead. Urban Emissions <a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> analyses
  the contribution of
  components such as traffic, dust and wind on the AQI at a particular
  location. They make use of a chemical transport model system known as
  WRF-CAMx for integrating the data. All the applications discussed here
  do not generate spatiotemporally aware recommendations and do not take
  into account the social makeup of a locality. Instead, they rely on
  centrally located sensors that may not be able to capture the complete
  dynamics of air pollution at a location.</p>
<p>Air quality research generally involves analyzing pollution sources,
  government policies, and their adverse effect on public health. For
  example, Agarwala M. and Chandel A. explain the role of crop residue
  burning on Delhi’s air quality <span class="citation" data-cites="AGARWALA-2020-ERL"></span> and Huang et al., studied
  the
  emission of pollutants from power generation plants <span class="citation" data-cites="HUANG-2017-RCR"></span>. We
  focus on social
  factors operating at the individual and institutional levels that affect
  the public’s perception and awareness of pollution. We use an ontology
  based approach to integrate the air quality data with the ethnographic
  data of locations.</p>
<h1 id="sec:req-analysis">Requirements Analysis</h1>
<p>We conducted a workshop on AQI and its social implications. The
  participants of this workshop include officials from the Central
  Pollution Control Board (CPCB)<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a>,
  social scientists,
  field workers and technologists. During the discussion, several issues
  were raised, such as the coverage of the centrally deployed sensors, the
  impact of air pollution on different social groups (students, daily wage
  workers, athletes, shopkeepers, etc.), the awareness about air pollution
  and AQI among the different social groups and the citizen participation
  to tackle the problem of air pollution. In order to get answers to these
  questions and to know the ground reality, two field workers were hired
  and asked to run a survey in two different regions of Delhi. These two
  regions were selected because they had variations in terms of demography
  and consisted of educational institutes, industries, dairy farms, sports
  academies and grocery stores. In each region, three different locations
  were selected to get a representation of the region’s demography and
  social groups.</p>
<p>After identifying the six locations, a field survey was conducted in
  these locations inquiring people about their awareness of the air
  quality indexes, their perception of pollution, and their views on
  government response towards pollution. The survey targeted six different
  social groups - teachers, students, mothers of young kids, local
  shopkeepers, sports academies, and social workers. At these six
  locations, air quality sensors were also deployed to study the
  hyperlocal AQI in the context of the social groups. Exposure to
  hyperlocal data increases local participation, which can make local
  institutions respond effectively to their local pollution problems. We
  term this as socializing and localizing the AQI in the neighborhood. The
  policies related to handling air pollution can be tuned by the local
  government bodies for each social group to address their specific needs.
  For example, the local school timings can be changed so that school
  children can avoid the time when the pollution is high.</p>
<p>The survey responses show that the AQI numbers and the data behind
  them are not interpretable to most people, even in Delhi, which has been
  one of the most polluted cities for consecutive years. Several survey
  respondents correctly identified the contributors to the air quality,
  which are crop burning, construction, and industries. However, except
  for the teachers and student social groups, others either did not have
  access to the AQI or were not able to draw any inferences from the AQI
  numbers. The local government bodies were also untrained to tackle the
  pollution locally and remained uninvolved.</p>
<p>Given this context, we proposed building a mobile and Web friendly
  application that is available in the local language. This application
  can increase the awareness of AQI by explaining the relevant facts and
  also recommend steps that can be taken locally to mitigate the problem
  of air pollution within a particular locality. In order to build such an
  application, the data from heterogeneous sources must be integrated and
  structured. So an ontology that can satisfy all the requirements
  discussed here will be appropriate for this application.</p>
<h2 id="competency-questions">Competency Questions</h2>
<p>From the workshop and the survey results, we collected the following
  minimal set of questions, also referred to as <em>competency
    questions</em>, that should be answered by the ontology.</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>What is the air pollution literacy of a particular social
      group?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is the major perception of people towards air quality in a
      region?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is the average AQI value at a place over a period of
      time?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How do people expect the government to mitigate the effect of air
      pollution in a region?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is the perception of people living in different regions
      towards air quality?</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>As can be observed from the competency questions, multiple data
  sources are required to answer them. They may have different structures
  and formats. These datasets include the AQI data, social data and
  meteorological data.</p>
<h1 id="sec:methodology">Methodology</h1>
<p>The methodology of building the SAQI ontology revolved around
  continual iterative development. We developed the ontology in two phases
  – building a barebones ontology consisting of classes and properties
  that were minimally essential and, later on, iteratively extending it
  based on the feedback and the requirements of the SAQI application. The
  former has led to the development of the Pollution ontology design
  pattern. In the latter phase,
  feedback on the ontology is obtained from the social scientists and the
  field workers in our team. An example of the importance of their
  feedback is the presence of the <code>Person</code> class. Since most of
  the survey responses are connected to the people living in a locality,
  the feedback was that it would be an important concept in the SAQI
  ontology.</p>
<p>Since reusing existing ontologies and vocabularies is a good
  practice, we reused three ontologies that are widely known. We reused
  the foaf <span class="citation" data-cites="brickley-d-2004--b"></span>,

<h1 id="sec:ontology-desc">Ontology Description</h1>
<p>The SAQI ontology is divided into three sub-ontologies, which we
  refer to as modules – <em>Pollution</em> module, built using Pollution
  ODP<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a>, <em>Trajectory</em> module
  built
  from the Trajectory ODP <a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> and
  <em>Ethnography</em> module for structural representation of field
  survey responses.
</p>
<h2 id="pollution">Pollution</h2>
<p>The Pollution ontology is extended from the Pollution ODP as shown in
  Figure <a href="#fig:pollution-module" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:pollution-module">1</a>. The ODP
  has been adapted to
  the air pollution domain by extending some of the classes from the ODP.
  For example, the <code>Pollutant</code> class is extended to
  <code>PrimaryPollutant</code> and <code>SecondaryPollutant</code>.
  <code>SecondaryPollutant</code> is further extended to
  <code>GaseousPollutant</code> and <code>ParticulateMatter</code>. Some
  of the important concepts and properties from the <em>Pollution</em>
  module are as follows.

    Pollution module</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>AirPollution.</strong> <code>AirPollution</code> class is
  extended from the <code>Pollution</code> class of the Pollution ODP. The
  <code>Pollution</code> class represents the different types of
  contaminants in the natural environment. <code>AirPollution</code> is
  linked to <code>Pollutant</code> through the <code>hasContributor</code>
  property (as shown in Axiom 1). The institutions working to mitigate the
  pollution sources through policies and awareness campaigns are linked by
  the object property <code>takesActionAgainst</code>. These properties
  and their connection with the <code>AirPollution</code> class is shown
  in Figure <a href="#fig:air_pollution_concepts" data-reference-type="ref"
    data-reference="fig:air_pollution_concepts">2</a>.

</figure>
<p><strong>hasContributor.</strong> This object property connects the
  <code>AirPollution</code> class to its direct and indirect contributors
  (pollutants).
</p>
<p><strong>takesActionAgainst.</strong> The institutions that are
  working to mitigate the effects of air pollution are connected through
  this object property. We considered two possible types of institutions –
  government and non-government institutions such as NGOs.</p>
<p><strong>Contributor.</strong> Contributor can either be a contaminant
  particle, i.e., <code>Pollutant</code> or it could be a
  <code>Carrier</code> that transports a <code>Pollutant</code>. The
  <code>Contributor</code> class and other related classes are shown in
  Figure <a href="#fig:contributor_concepts" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:contributor_concepts">3</a>.
</p>
<figure>

    alt="Contributor class and its connections" />
  <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Contributor class and its
    connections</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>carriesPollutant.</strong> This object property is used with
  an <code>IndirectContributor</code> that transports a
  <code>Pollutant</code> from one spatial location to another, for
  example, wind and water flow.
</p>
<p><strong>DirectContributor.</strong> The
  <code>DirectContributor</code> class represents the contributors that
  directly impact pollution. <code>Pollutant</code> is a subclass of
  <code>DirectContributor</code>. Some examples of pollutants include
  biological pollutants (viruses, pathogens, bacteria, etc.), chemical
  pollutants (toxic metal, radionuclides, organophosphorus compounds,
  gases, etc.) and physical pollutants (sound, thermal energy, space
  debris, etc.) present in a particular environment.
</p>
<p><strong>IndirectContributor.</strong> The
  <code>IndirectContributor</code> concept represents concepts that
  indirectly contribute to pollution at a particular spatiotemporal point.
  These include environmental factors like temperature, the air or water
  streams flowing into or out of a particular place, the socio-economic
  factors such as policies and demographics. We have modelled only the
  <code>Carrier</code> concept as the subclass of
  <code>IndirectContributor</code> since other indirect contributors are
  specific to certain kinds of pollution.
</p>
<p><strong>Carrier.</strong> This concept is a subclass of the
  <code>IndirectContributor</code> concept and represents the air, water,
  and other kinds of streams flowing into or out of a particular place. It
  is linked to the <code>Trajectory</code> concept through the
  <code>hasTrajectory</code> property. Carriers are generally observed to
  affect the concentration of pollutants at a particular place and are
  important in modeling pollutants. To represent the pollutants that might
  be carried through a trajectory, the <code>Carrier</code> concept is
  linked to the <code>Pollutant</code> concept by the
  <code>carriesPollutant</code> property.
</p>
<p><strong>Pollutant.</strong> <code>Pollutant</code> is a central
  concept in the Pollution module. It is associated with the
  <code>Observation</code> class to keep a record of pollutant
  concentrations at any location and timestamp. Each pollutant has a
  prescribed standard that is defined by the government authorities. The
  <code>Pollutant</code> class and its connections are shown in Figure <a href="#fig:pollutant_concepts"
    data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:pollutant_concepts">4</a>.
</p>
<p><strong>hasPrescribedStandard.</strong> Links a pollutant with
  standard limits based on concentration/amount of that pollutant in the
  environment. For example, WHO prescribed standard for PM<span class="math inline"><sub>2.5</sub></span> is less than 5
  <span class="math inline"><em>μ</em><em>g</em>/<em>m</em><sup>3</sup></span>
  mean concentration in the air annually.
</p>
<p><strong>hasObservation.</strong> This is used to capture the
  concentration of a particular pollutant at a given time and spatial
  location.</p>
<figure>
  <img src="figures/Pollutants.png" id="fig:pollutant_concepts" style="width:80.0%;height:6cm"
    alt="Pollutant class and its connections" />
  <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Pollutant class and its
    connections</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>PrescribedStandardForPollutants.</strong> This is a stub
  meta-pattern <span class="citation" data-cites="stub_MP"></span> that
  can be used to describe the prescribed ranges for pollutants. For a
  particular location, pollutants have a defined range of permissible
  concentrations that are specified by various global authorities. A
  standard for a pollutant may change with time and place. Hence the
  <code>PrescribedStandardForPollutants</code> concept is linked to the
  <code>Observation</code> concept by the <code>hasObservation</code>
  property.
</p>
<p><strong>PollutantGenerator.</strong> Pollutant generators are events
  that generate pollution, such as crop burning, power plants, waste
  burning and dusty weather. It is related to the <code>Perception</code>
  class in the <em>Ethnography</em> module, indicating the perception of
  people on the severity of pollution concentration in a specific area.
  The <code>PollutantGenerator</code> class and its connections are shown
  in Figure <a href="#fig:pollutant_generator" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:pollutant_generator">5</a>.
</p>
<p><strong>nearby.</strong> This property links a pollution generator to
  a carrier trajectory.</p>
<p><strong>SourceResponsibleForLocalPollution.</strong> The perception
  of pollution is directly linked to observable pollution generators in a
  locality, resulting in the perception of pollution by the people in that
  locality.</p>

<h2 id="trajectory">Trajectory</h2>
<p>Concepts in the <em>Trajectory</em> module uses the concepts from the
  Pollution ODP (Figure <a href="#fig:trajectory_concepts" data-reference-type="ref"
    data-reference="fig:trajectory_concepts">6</a>). It models the
  trajectories of pollution carriers. For example, a wind current passing
  through a crop burning site may carry carbon based pollutants to another
  destination. This displacement of pollutants needs to be accounted for
  in order to get a holistic understanding of air pollution. The
  trajectory component has been adapted from the Trajectory ODP <span class="citation"
    data-cites="10.1007/978-3-319-01790-7_24"></span>. A
  brief description of the <em>Trajectory</em> module concepts is given
  below.</p>

    alt="Trajectory class and its connections" />
  <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Trajectory class and its
    connections</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>Trajectory.</strong> The <code>Trajectory</code> concept
  represents a set of ordered spatiotemporal points.</p>
<p><strong>TrajectoryPoint and TrajectorySegment.</strong> The
  <code>Trajectory</code> concept is linked to the
  <code>TrajectoryPoint</code> and <code>TrajectorySegment</code> through
  the <code>hasPoint</code> and <code>hasSegment</code> properties. The
  <code>nextPoint</code> property links trajectory points in the
  appropriate order within a trajectory. The segments in the trajectory
  are defined by a starting trajectory point {<span class="math inline"><em>x</em><sub><em>i</em></sub></span>, <span
    class="math inline"><em>y</em><sub><em>i</em></sub></span>, <span
    class="math inline"><em>t</em><sub><em>i</em></sub></span>} and an
  ending trajectory point {<span class="math inline"><em>x</em><sub><em>j</em></sub></span>, <span
    class="math inline"><em>y</em><sub><em>j</em></sub></span>, <span
    class="math inline"><em>t</em><sub><em>j</em></sub></span>} where <span
    class="math inline"><em>t</em><sub><em>i</em></sub></span>, <span
    class="math inline"><em>t</em><sub><em>j</em></sub></span> denote time
  points such that <span class="math inline"><em>t</em><sub><em>i</em></sub></span> <span
    class="math inline">&lt;</span> <span class="math inline"><em>t</em><sub><em>j</em></sub></span> . The
  <code>TrajectorySegment</code> concept represents this notion of a
  segment which is connected to two fixes through <code>startsFrom</code>
  and <code>endsAt</code> properties.
</p>
<h2 id="ethnography">Ethnography</h2>
<p>This ontology module captures the ethnographic details of a location
  we obtained from the field survey. This data and the ontology can help
  in framing policies and making decisions to mitigate air pollution at
  the hyperlocal level. The <em>Ethnography</em> module is shown in
  Figure <a href="#fig:ethnographic_concepts" data-reference-type="ref"
    data-reference="fig:ethnographic_concepts">7</a>.</p>
<figure>

    alt="Overview of the Ethnography module" />
  <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Overview of the Ethnography
    module</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>Person.</strong> This is a core concept of this module since
  the ethnographic data relies on the observations of a person. The data
  we collect relates a person to their knowledge of air pollution and
  accounts for the social makeup through the aggregation of person-level
  data. This concept is connected to concepts such as
  <code>AirPollutionLiteracy</code>, <code>Perception</code> and
  <code>Region</code> through the <code>hasAirPollutionLiteracy</code>,
  <code>hasPerception</code> and <code>livesIn</code> properties.
</p>
<p><strong>AirPollutionLiteracy.</strong> This concept describes the air
  pollution literacy of the people in a locality. We assess this by asking
  questions<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> to the people related
  to their
  awareness of AQI and air pollution in general. The
  <code>AirPollutionLiteracy</code> concept has the data properties
  <code>hasAQILiteracy</code>,
  <code>hasAirPollutionGraphicLiteracy</code>,
  <code>hasParticulateMatterLiteracy</code> and
  <code>hasAQIColorLiteracy</code>.
</p>
<p><strong>Perception.</strong> This concept captures the perception of
  an individual with regard to the level of air pollution in their local
  neighbourhood and the city. It consists of data properties such as
  <code>howIsYourLocalityComparedToOtherAreas</code> (the literals that
  can be linked using this property are “equally polluted”, “less
  polluted”, “more polluted”, “don’t know”),
  <code>shouldPollutionIssuesBeRaisedInElections</code> and
  <code>localAirQualityRating</code>. An aggregation of people’s
  perceptions in a particular region is expected to give the perception of
  that region.
</p>
<h1 id="sec:shacl">SHACL Shapes</h1>
<p>SHACL<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> can be used to enforce
  constraints
  on the KG. The constraints are defined in shape graphs. KG need to
  satisfy the condition specified in the shape graphs to be validated.
  Shapes for the prominent classes, such as <code>Person</code> and
  <code>AirPollution</code> were created and the triples that were
  generated from the data using YARRRML mappings were validated using the
  SHACL constraints. An example of a SHACL shape of the
  <code>Person</code> class is as follows. The first few constraints

<h1 id="sec:app">SAQI Application</h1>
<p>We built a mobile and Web friendly SAQI application (Figure <a href="#fig:saqi_layout" data-reference-type="ref"
    data-reference="fig:saqi_layout">[fig:saqi_layout]</a>)<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"
    role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a>
  that makes use of the KG to answer questions related to air quality. To
  mitigate the knowledge barrier in the understanding of AQI, increase
  awareness related to air pollution and improve citizen engagement, the
  app is designed to address all the sections of the community, which
  includes tech ill-literate people majorly. This is achieved using
  features such as support for local language – Hindi/English, heavy/large
  fonts, minimal inputs from the user, text-to-speech narration on every
  page and colorful graphics for AQI readings. The app consists of
  knowledge on air pollution and its effects which caters to specific
  social and spatial cohorts and also acts as AQI monitoring app that
  utilizes a KG built using SAQI ontology</p>
<p>A SPARQL endpoint (Figure <a href="#fig:saqi_sparql" data-reference-type="ref"
    data-reference="fig:saqi_sparql">[fig:saqi_sparql]</a>) is also embedded
  in the application with eight queries on the pollution sensors data and
  the ethnography data from surveys. The SPARQL endpoint can be accessed
  from the app at <a href="https://https://saqi-er24.netlify.app/saqi/app/#/sparql"
    class="uri">https://https://saqi-er24.netlify.app/saqi/app/#/sparql</a>.</p>
<p>The ethnographic data, pollution data from local and central sensors
  are mapped to triples using RDF Mapping Language (RML) helper tool
  YARRML <a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> <span class="citation"
    data-cites="YARRRML"></span> that provides a high level format to define
  R2RML and RML rules. The generated triples are then uploaded to the
  server running Apache Jena Fuseki<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"
    role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> as the triple store. A
  cron job running on the server takes care of new triples that need to be
  uploaded to the server periodically, taking care of preprocessing and
  validation of data using SHACL constraints.</p>
<h1 id="sec:sustainability">Sustainability and Maintenance of
  Resources</h1>
<p>Since the YARRRML mappings are used, it is easy to generate KG from
  air quality sensor data and survey data. This is scalable, i.e., we can
  expand to more regions and get more data. As long as the format of the
  data does not change, the process of converting heterogeneous sensor and
  survey data to KG is sustainable. Over time, the SAQI ontology and the
  application may need changes. We will continue to work on SAQI platform
  and make changes whenever required. We also hope that the community will
  be interested and will take this up. Since all the resources are
  publicly available, it will be possible to make changes and share them
  with the community.</p>
<h1 id="sec:conclusion">Conclusion and Future Work</h1>
<p>We proposed Social Air Quality Index (SAQI), a new approach to
  increase awareness about air pollution awareness, democratize AQI
  knowledge at the neighbourhood level and improve community
  participation. We have developed an ODP for pollution <a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"
    role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a>,
  SAQI ontology to model the local and central air quality data, as well
  as the ethnographic survey data from six localities in Delhi. The sensor
  and survey data are integrated into a KG using YARRRML mappings and the
  SAQI ontology. We designed a neighbourhood pollution dashboard (SAQI
  app) that makes use of the KG to answer questions related to air
  pollution and the steps that each social cohort (students, teachers,
  mothers of young kids, athletes, etc.) can take to mitigate the effects
  of air pollution. The app is available in the local language. All these
  resources are publicly available under an Apache License 2.0 at <a href="https://github.com/XXXX/XX-XXXXXXXX-XXXXXXX"
    class="uri">https://github.com/XXXX/XX-XXXXXXXX-XXXXXXX</a>
  and <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.XXXXXXX" class="uri">https://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.XXXXXXX</a>.</p>
<p>Going forward, we plan to incorporate more social characteristics
  from the neighbourhood into the ontology and the SAQI app such as
  addresses and contact for local government officials and the local
  pollution generating sources. We also plan to introduce graphical
  visualization in the app to explain the distribution and variation of
  AQI with respect to the time of the day, the seasonal variations and its
  correlation to activities in the neighbourhood.</p>
