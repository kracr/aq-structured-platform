abstract="Trajectory data have been used in a variety of studies, including human behavior analysis, transportation management, and wildlife tracking. While each study area introduces a different perspective, they share the need to integrate positioning data with domain-specific information. Semantic annotations are necessary to improve discovery, reuse, and integration of trajectory data from different sources. Consequently, it would be beneficial if the common structure encountered in trajectory data could be annotated based on a shared vocabulary, abstracting from domain-specific aspects. Ontology design patterns are an increasingly popular approach to define such flexible and self-contained building blocks of annotations. They appear more suitable for the annotation of interdisciplinary, multi-thematic, and multi-perspective data than the use of foundational and domain ontologies alone. In this paper, we introduce such an ontology design pattern for semantic trajectories. It was developed as a community effort across multiple disciplines and in a data-driven fashion. We discuss the formalization of the pattern using the Web Ontology Language (OWL) and apply the pattern to two different scenarios, personal travel and wildlife monitoring.",

abstract = {As the fast growth of China’s economy, power generation has greatly increased in past decades. Majority of power generation in China is from coal-fired power plants. Large and still increasing amount of coal combustion for power generation emits numerous pollutants into atmosphere. Combining with emissions from other sources, power generation contributes to the severe air pollution in recent years. In this study, the historic trends and current status of the impact of power generation on air quality in China are overviewed. In 2012, the power sector contributed 30\% of CO2, 33\% of NOx, 23\% of SO2, 8\% of particulate matter (PM), 3\% of CO, and less than 1\% of VOCs emissions in China. The power sector contributed 15\% of NOx, 13\% of SO2, 27\% of O3, 26\% of fine particulate NO3− and 22\% of fine particulate SO42− ambient concentrations. Coal consumption for power generation is keeping growing. Tremendous efforts have been made to limit emissions from power generation by installing flue-gas desulphurization systems on coal-fired power plant, resulting in reduction of SO2 and PM emissions recently. However, emissions of NOx, CO2, CO, and VOCs are still increasing. Over half of the power emissions and concentrations are distributed in East and North China, which include the Yangtze River Delta and the North China Plain, the two most developed and populous regions in China. Emissions from power generation contribute significant fractions of NOx, SO2, and particulate NO3− in winter, and significant fractions of O3 and particulate SO42− in summer.}

               investigate if the graduates of the BEEd program of Bataan
               Peninsula State University Dinalupihan Campus have met the
               expectations provided in CMO No. 74 series of 2017. This study
               uses an explanatory-sequential design which is a two-phase
               approach, where quantitative results of the study, from
               collected quantitative data using a survey questionnaire in
               phase 1 were followed up and supported by qualitative data
               collected in phase 2 to further explain the findings. The
               results of the study indicate that significant difference is
               evident in the competency of the respondents based on the
               expected competencies as stated at CMO No. 74, series of 2017 in

               grouped accordingly, as provided by the p-values which are
               statistically lesser than the alpha of .05. In general,
               graduates confidently believes that they possess the
               competencies stated and describe in CMO No. 74 s. 2017, their
               Cooperating Teachers and Coordinators, however, based on their
